# AI-Sketch-Pad
Pygame application recognizes digits drawn on a sketch pad

## Overview

*This is a desktop application developed using PyGame. This application recognizes the digits drawn on it and outputs the result in real-time. I have used a small convolutional neural network for digit recognition. The model was trained on approximately 100,000 images and achieved 99.7% test accuracy on the Kaggle test dataset and ranks among the top 6% submissions.*

## Walkthrough

![Run the program](/ss/p1.png)

> This is the sketch pad.


![Run the program](/ss/p2.png)

> We can draw any number and the neural network model shows the result in runtime.


![Run the program](/ss/p3.png)

> Here I have drawn 3 and then I am converting the figure into other digits and the models recognizes it perfectly.
